This is the place where I will put all my trash-apps. Enjoy :)
There will be 2 files with .apk the first one is for devices with small screens. Install it when you've got a device with a small screen. Mindblowing isn't it?
The other one is for medium screens and even for large screens. As long as you dont download it on a tablet you're good to go.
Update 10.01.2021:
There is an app-release_v1.Beta.apk file it should work on smaller and larger screens but the tablet support isnt there (thats why its called Beta). And in this build you can now swap the background by tapping on the three dots in the upper right corner.
