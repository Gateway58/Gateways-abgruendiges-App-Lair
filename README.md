# Gateways-abgruendiges-App-Lair
This is the place where I will put all my trash-apps. Enjoy :)
The name of the App on your Phone is the same as the name of the branch!.
Working (in the correct order): 
Calculator : First all or most screen support and then the rules
Dates: First an all or most screen support and then the the release(This project is nothing special like all my projects. It is just a worse stopwatch in which you can customize the message)
???: making a quiz app.
Note: When the all or most screen support is finished only one .apk files should be necessary {[(i guess)]}
