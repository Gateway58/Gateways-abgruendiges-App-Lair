# Gateways-abgruendiges-App-Lair
This is the place where I will put all my trash-apps. Enjoy :)
The name of the App on your Phone is the same as the name of the branch!. 
After a long break from android studio and java, to learn more c++ and c# and get used to unity. 
I now want to make progress into the quiz app I test buildet 2 times and make now THE LAST build with A BETTER NAME THAN BEFORE. 
By the way, I'm done for now with the one math app so...yeah maybe I will come back to it, but now that I think about it 
I think its a good demonstration of what I was able to do a couple of months ago compared to now. Quiz App development will start in the next few days
and it may be released at the end of the year, because I want to make it really good.It will be open source when I finish it and I plan on documenting 
a couple of things I will learn from building this app.
